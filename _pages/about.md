## The Difficulty Presented by Conventional Weather Models

Conventional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models use supercomputers to replicate the physics of the atmosphere. Despite their effectiveness, these models are limited by computational bottlenecks and the requirement for regular updates. Enhancing these models requires either more advanced atmospheric simulations or higher resolution, both of which are computationally expensive.

## Understanding Numerical Weather Prediction Models

NWP models rely on mathematical equations that detail the atmosphere's behavior. Numerical methods are used to solve these equations, which are based on the principles of physics, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics. The procedure includes:
*	**Data Collection:** Gathering observational data from satellites, weather stations, radars, and other sources.
*	**Data Assimilation:** Incorporating observational data into the model to establish an initial state.
*	**Model Integration:** Advancing the model forward in time to forecast upcoming atmospheric conditions.
*	**Forecast Refinement:** Creating user-friendly weather forecasts from the initial model output.
Even though NWP models are advanced, they still have inherent limitations. The atmosphere is an unpredictable system, so even minor errors in the initial conditions can result in significant discrepancies in the prediction. Moreover, the practicality of running high-resolution models over large areas is restricted by computational demands.The Emergence of Neural Network ModelsNeural networks such as MetNet-2 tackle these issues by learning from data instead of relying on manually coded physics. These models are capable of efficient parallel processing, enabling frequent and accurate high-resolution predictions. MetNet-2 excels in forecasting primary precipitation goals and surpasses advanced physics-based models for a lead time of up to twelve hours in the Continental United States.

## How Neural Networks Work

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They are composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) arranged in layers, which analyze input information and produce output projections. Important elements include:
*	**Input Layer:** Receives raw data, such as weather reports and satellite images.
*	**Hidden Layers:** Conduct intricate operations and extract features using weighted connections and activation functions.
*	**Output Layer:** Generates the final forecast, such as rainfall levels or temperature measurements.
Training a neural network involves adjusting connection weights to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and actual values. This iterative process, called backpropagation, enhances the model's accuracy.

## Advanced Prediction of Future Events

One notable characteristic of MetNet-2 is its capability to offer forecasts with high resolution. MetNet-2 provides precise and current weather forecasts with a spatial resolution of 1 km and updates every two minutes.
