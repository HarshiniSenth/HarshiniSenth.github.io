## Understanding Numerical Weather Prediction Models

NWP models rely on mathematical equations that detail the atmosphere's behavior. Numerical methods are used to solve these equations, which are based on the principles of physics, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics. The procedure includes:

Even though NWP models are advanced, they still have inherent limitations. The atmosphere is an unpredictable system, so even minor errors in the initial conditions can result in significant discrepancies in the prediction. Moreover, the practicality of running high-resolution models over large areas is restricted by computational demands.The Emergence of Neural Network ModelsNeural networks such as MetNet-2 tackle these issues by learning from data instead of relying on manually coded physics.
